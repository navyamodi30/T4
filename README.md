ðŸ“ˆ Sentiment Analysis in Action ðŸ“ˆ

Understanding public opinion is crucial in today's data-driven world. During my internship, I analyzed and visualized sentiment patterns in social media data to gauge attitudes toward specific topics and brands.

This project allowed me to dive into natural language processing (NLP), uncovering sentiment trends and providing actionable insights to inform strategic decisions.
